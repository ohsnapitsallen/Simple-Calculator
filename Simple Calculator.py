#Create a function for the calculator
def calculate():

    #Use try method to ask the user for numbers and operators
    try:
        first = float(input("Enter any number (Can be a whole number or a decimal): "))
        op = str(input('Enter an operator (Must be plus "+", minus "-", times "*", or divide "/": '))
        second = float(input("Enter another number (Can be a whole number or a decimal): "))
#Use if statements for solving the two numbers depending on the operator that user has inputted
#Create error messages if user's input are invalid or user divides with zero
#Create an empty variable for the while loop to be used later
#Print a welcome message
#Use the while loop to ask the user if they would like to use the program again
#Use if statements depending on the user's response
